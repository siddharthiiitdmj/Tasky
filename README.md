# Tasky
  -> It is basically a task management web app(to-do list) built using html, bootstrap and javascript.<br />
  -> In this you can add a task with its details and timings.<br />
  -> The card created on adding a task can be updated or deleted at any moment necessary.<br />
  -> I also added functionality to search for a particular card using the card title.<br />
  
 Here is the deployed website of the project [Tasky](https://siddharthiiitdmj.github.io/Tasky/).
